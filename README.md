# Wireless-Sensor-Network-Home-Automation

Prototype system for indoor monitoring and automation of a residential building where developed sensor
network is implemented and deployed in a residential environment to autonomously collect 
environmental conditions of a unit and enable control of wireless devices, remotely. The 
outcome of this project provides a system platform that reads and publishes sensor data in 
real-time on a web interface. The system is developed for house inhabitants to utilize in 
monitoring environmental conditions of their homes to aid in determining cost-effective 
methods to reducing energy consumptions. The platform also provides interface to control 
remote device, typically a switch, will be controlled wirelessly using the same interface.
